8 basic Flow examples where simple things are broken and fixable in each one.

Some of the examples are adapted from [here](http://flowtype.org/docs/five-simple-examples.html).

To get started, install flow based on [these](http://flowtype.org/docs/getting-started.html) instructions. Then, run `flow check` in the root directory to check all files, or `flow check-contents < [file-name]` to check one at a time.

# Presentation

JavaScript is dynamically typed.

Sometimes things break at runtime.

Some people want things to break at compile-time instead.

People are inventing compile-to-JS languages for that. (PureScript, TypeScript, etc)

But I already wrote SOOOO much JavaScript...
